# Helmes Test Assignment

I used C#/.NET for API because I am well familiar with the language. Additionally, there was a boilerplate provided so I based my solution on it.
For frontend I used React framework as I have the most experience with it. 

### Technical requirements to run solution
- node v18.18
- npm v9.8
- .NET SDK v8.0

### To run project:
- open Docker Desktop application in your device
- run `docker-compose up --build -d` in project terminal
- navigate to http://localhost:8181/
